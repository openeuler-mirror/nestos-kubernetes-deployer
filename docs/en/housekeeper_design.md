# Housekeeper

## overview

In the cloud-native domain, business deployment and operation are mainly achieved through container technology and container orchestration technology, which highly decouples them from the underlying environment. However, this also brings about the problem of inconsistent operation and maintenance (O&M) technology stacks, leading to separate management of Kubernetes (k8s) and the underlying operating system, as well as redundant construction of O&M platforms. To address these issues, NKD integrates the housekeeper module, ensuring consistency in operation and maintenance between business and the NestOS cloud base operating system. Operational management is conducted through containerization. The primary update process of housekeeper involves rebuilding the new version system image using image construction tools when the operating system or k8s basic components require upgrade and maintenance. After discovering the new version image, it creates housekeeper CR resources in the cluster. Housekeeper services in the cluster sequentially upgrade cluster nodes according to the configuration, completing the entire cluster's upgrade process.

## Architecture Introduction
housekeeper's architecture is shown:
![housekeeper-arch](/docs/en/figures/housekeeper-arch.jpg)
As shown in the diagram, housekeeper mainly consists of three components: housekeeper-operator-manager, housekeeper-controller-manager, and housekeeper-daemon.
- housekeeper-operator-manager: Running in the form of a Deployment on the Master node, responsible for coordinating all Machines for upgrades (not directly responsible for updates) and marking nodes ready for upgrade.
- housekeeper-controller-managerï¼šRunning in the form of a DaemonSet on all nodes in the cluster, responsible for evicting business pods and forwarding upgrade information to housekeeper-daemon.
- housekeeper-daemon: Receives information from housekeeper-controller-manager and performs atomic updates of the OS or upgrades Kubernetes version according to instructions
